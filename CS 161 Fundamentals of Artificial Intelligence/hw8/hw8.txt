1.  Included in this folder is my test.net file which contains the Bayesian 
    network for the problem. In SamIAm, I constrained the Test node to be 
    Positive and ran a sensitivity analysis for Pr(D|T) >= 3. The suggested
    values it gave me were:

    Pr(Disease = Positive) >= 0.008942      
    - current value was 0.001
    Pr(Test = Positive | Disease = Negative) <= 0.002219
    - current value was 0.02

	a. 

	Variables				Possible Values

	ExpectingGuests			Yes, No, N/A
	FamilyHome				Yes, No, N/A
	SoundSensor				On, Off, N/A
	LightSensor 			On, Off, N/A
	HearableBarking			Yes, No, N/A
	Battery					OK, Dead, N/A
	SoundSensorHealth		OK, Broken, N/A
	LightSensorHealth		OK, Broken, N/A
	DogBarking				Yes, No, N/A
	DogOutside				Yes, No, N/A
	OutdoorLight			On, Off, N/A
	DogBowelTrouble			Yes, No, N/A

	b. 

	ExpectingGuests => OutdoorLight
	FamilyHome => DogOutside
	DogBowelTrouble => DogOutside
	DogOutside => DogBarking
	DogBarking => HearableBarking
	HearableBarking => SoundSensor
	OutdoorLight => LightSensor
	SoundSensorHealth => SoundSensor
	LightSensorHealth => LightSensor
	Battery => SoundSensor
	Battery => LightSensor
	ExpectingGuests => FamilyHome
	FamilyHome => OutdoorLight

	c. 

	After constructing the network from the causal structure, I ran the EM 
	Learning algorithm on the structure. 

	- 	For the first instantiation, I set the LightSensor variable to On and
		the SoundSensor variable to Off. I then ran the MPE computation with 
		this given info and got:

		Battery								OK
		DogBarking							No
		DogBowelTrouble						Yes
		DogOutside							Yes
		ExpectingGuests						No
		FamilyHome							No
		HearableBarking						No
		LightSensorHealth					OK
		OutdoorLight						On
		SoundSensorHealth					OK

		Running MAP on this yielded the same result.

	-	For the second instantiation, I set ExpectingGuests to No and 
		FamilyHome to Yes. Running MPE gave me the following instantiations 
		for the sensors:

		LightSensor								Off
		SoundSensor 							Off

		Running MAP on this yielded the same result.

	- 	One set for Z could be { Battery, DogOutside }. We can see taht Battery 
		and DogOutside d-separate the two sensors, causing them to be 
		conditionally independent. 

	- 	The network here is a multiply-connected network.
