First I ran /usr/local/cs/bin/sort to check the version of my sort which was 
new enough (2014).

Next I generated a file of 10,000,000 random double-precision floats, each 
separated by a newline, by running od -An -f -N 40000000 < /dev/urandom | tr -s
' ' '\n' | sed '1d' > random.txt

I then ran wc -l random.txt to make sure it had 10 million lines of text

Next, I ran time -p /usr/local/cs/bin/sort -g --parallel=N random.txt > 
/dev/null to run a benchmark test with N being the number of threads. I started with N as 1, then 2, 4, and 8 threads. My results were as follows:

Threads		real		user		sys
1		95.78		95.63		0.18
2		51.79		97.72		0.21
4		32.27		102.78		1.40
8		24.74		114.56		2.90

Given these results, one can see that by using more threads, the real time 
decreases and the process finishes faster.
