wget 
http://www.cs.ucla.edu/classes/winter15/cs35L/assign/coreutils-with-bug.tar.gz
tar -xvf [file]
- get the coreutils tar and untar it

cd coreutils-with-bug
./configure CFLAGS='-g3 -O0'
- unoptimized code for debugging

make
- make sure that running this fails

wget http://www.cs.ucla.edu/classes/winter15/cs35L/assign/coreutils.diff

patch -p0 < coreutils.diff

make clean
- clear binaries compiled before
make
- this should work now
- the patch fixed the make command because it prepended "coreutils_" before 
  all the functions which I assume is the correct name of those functions
  which previously were not working. 

- run commands on spec
- instead of the ls command listed on the spec I did:
TZ=UTCO ~/Downloads/coreutils-with-bug/src/ls -lt --full-time wwi-armistice
now now1
- this was because I was in the tmp directory and just calling ls wouldn't
  work for me
- now the bug has been successfully reproduced
- error was because a very negative number becomes a positive (overflow)

vim src/ls.c
/sort
- I examined the ls.c file and searched for the keyword "sort" 
- I found a static void function called sort_files that I could start with

gdb [path to the ls function I downloaded]
break sort_files
run -lt wwi-armistice now now1
- I do this while in the tmp directory 
- set a breakpoint at sort_files and run it
- I found a condition that went
func = sort_reverse ? rev_cmp_mtime : compare_mtime
- I then ran list on rev_cmp_mtime first and found that it also calls 
  compare_mtime. Listing compare_mtime then led me to the function called
  cmp_mtime. Following the same procedure, I find that this function returns 
  an int, which is determind by another function called timespec_cmp. 

break timespec_cmp
- the breakpoint shows that the function is located in another file, called
  timespec.h in the lib directory
- the function evaluates a int diff from a.tv_sec - b.tv_sec
- I print the diff result and it's a very negative number.
    - this was because a was a very high positive number and b was a very
      negative number; the difference exceeded the limit for ints and turned
      into a negative number by overflowing. 

cd ../lib
vim timespec.h 
- I edited the file and changed diff into an unsigned long long so it could
  hold more extreme values. I also typecasted its arguments a.tv_sec and 
  b.tv_sec into unsigned long longs.
- I then added if statements for the result of diff
  - if it was positive, I returned 1, 0 I returned 0 and negative I returned
    -1 
- After this, I ran gdb again with the same breakpoints and got an error 
  saying that the source file is more recent than the executable.

./configure
make
- making the tmp directory again after this and running commands, the order
  was corrected
- I realized I needed to keep a copy of the lib dir so I went and untar'd 
  the coreutils again

diff -u /path/to/modified/timespec.h /path/to/original/timespec.h > lab5.diff
- create the unified diff file
- I then modified the beginning to make --- and +++ point to the same timespec
  file and then added a ChangeLog

- running the same commands on the SEASNet Linux servers instead of a tmp
  directory, the ls command listed the files in the wrong order, with the 
  wwi-armistice file shown as being created in the year 2054.
