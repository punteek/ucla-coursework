The top panel of the gitk interface shows the history of commits, separated by
branch. It has three panels. The leftmost panel shows the branching, if a 
user merged a branch, we would see that as a diagonal line. The second panel 
lists the corresponding authors and their e-mails, and the last panel shows
the dates of these commits. 

Below, the top left panel gives the details of the specific commit we 
highlight, like its parents, children, branches and author. Below that, is
the diff file so we can see the changes that were applied.

Lastly, the right panel shows the files that were modified in the highlighted
commit.
