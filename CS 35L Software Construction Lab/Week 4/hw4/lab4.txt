1. git clone git://git.savannah.gnu.org/diffutils.git
cd diffutils
pwd

2. git log > git-log.txt

3. git tag > git-tags.txt

4. git log --oneline --grep="maint: quote"
- find the commit, id is 62ca21c

git format-patch -1 62ca21c --stdout > ../quote-patch.txt
- -1 targets only this commit
- creates patch file in directory above

5. git checkout v3.0
- goes to version 3.0, as shown in the tags

6. patch -f -p1 < ../quote-patch.txt
- apply patch forcefully

7. git status
- I see that some files were changed that were not .c files

8. emacs [non .c file] 
C-x v =
- brings up the vc-diff buffer in Emacs
C-x v u
- reverts all the changes to a file while in vc-diff buffer
- I did this procedure for every non .c file
 
// alternative to #8
git checkout NEWS README TODO doc/diagmeet.note ms/config.bat
ms/config.site po/en.po tests/help-version src/diff.h src/system.h


9. git checkout -p
- delete changes to comments, variable declarations

10. emacs diff3.c.rej, emacs diff.c.rej
- find the changes made and apply them manually to the corresponding files
  diff3.c and diff.c 

11. git clean -f
- remove untracked files (not under version control)

12. git diff | wc -l
- I got 326 lines, which falls within the 300-400 line range

git diff > ../quote-3.0-patch.txt
- creates a patch file from the diff

13. export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/cs/bin
- need help2man command

./bootstrap
./configure
make

./src/diff . -
- outputs "cannot compare '-' to a directory"
- has the right quotation marks

14. mkdir diffutils-3.0-patch, mkdir diffutils-3.0
cp -r src/ ../diffutils-3.0-patch/
- copy src directory recursively into newly created directory

git checkout v3.0
cp -r src/ ../diffutils-3.0/
- copy original src directory into other directory

diffutils-3.0-patch/src/diff -pru diffutils-3.0 diffutils-3.0-patch/ >
quote-3.0-test.txt

diff -pru diffutils-3.0 diffutils-3.0-patch > quote-3.0-test.txt
- the files are not identical because I reverted the changes in the .c files
  that affected character string constants
- these differences are expected and not innocuous since they change only
  the string literals
