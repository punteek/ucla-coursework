=========
Problem 1
=========
For the buffered version of cat, I used the stdio.h library's functions 
getchar() and putchar() to read and write respectively. To read one character
at a time, I just set getchar()'s return to a char variable and looped until
the end of the file.

=========
Problem 2
=========
For the unbuffered version of cat, I used the unistd.h library's functions
read and write, reading from 0 (stdin) and output to 1 (stdout). To read in
one character at a time, I created an array of 1 and passed it into the read
function.  

=========
Problem 3
=========
To see the system calls I made a shell script to echo 5 million 0's into a
file to ensure that it would be 5mb. Then I built the two cat programs using
gcc and then ran strace ./catu < file and strace./catb < file. 

=========
Problem 4
=========
time ./catu < file

Running this yielded the results:
 real 0m 6.030s
 user 0m 0.285s
 sys  0m 5.737s

time ./catb < file

Running this yielded the results:
 real 0m 1.830s
 user 0m 0.148s
 sys  0m 0.037s

The unbuffered version takes longer as expected because of the system calls
it must make.
