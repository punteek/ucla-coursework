wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-7.6.tar.gz
tar -xzvf coreutils-7.6.tar.gz
- get the tar.gz file and unpack it

mkdir utilsInstall, pwd
- make directory for install destination and get the path of it

cd coreutils-7.6, ./configure --prefix=[path of new directory]
- set install destination to the directory we just made

make
- compiles Makefile source code into binaries
make install
- takes those binaries and copies them into the appropriate location, in this
  case the utilsInstall directory

cd utilsInstall, ./bin/ls -l /bin/bash
- check the installed ls to make sure it's the wrong format

vim patch_file, copy in patch from website
- copy the lines starting from index
- add space before every line except those that start with -, + or @
  - for proper diff indentation, since I copied from the browser
patch -p1 < patch_file
- p1 option ignores up to the first backslash when reading the patch file, so
  a/NEWS becomes NEWS, since we are working in the curren directory
make
- compile the patch 
- none of the commands are needed except the ls.c one because that's the only 
  executable that we changed
make install
- install the patch

cd utilInstall
touch -d 20120101 testfile
- create a test file, that was "created" Jan 1, 2012
./bin/ls -l testfile
- test our installed ls function on the new file, which works and displays
  Jan 1 2012
