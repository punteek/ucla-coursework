Question 1
==========
Brady removed the line because the line before it had the exact same line. It 
wasn't technically necessary to remove that line, since the switch statement
in the code would function the same either way, but it eliminates redundancy
from the file and makes it easier to read.

Question 2
==========
To non-English speakers, the date format may confuse them, since other 
countries may be accustomed to seeing the day before the month, or some other
order. Also, the months are abbreviated in English which would pose another
problem, since non-English speakers may interpret them as meaning something
else. 

Question 3
==========
Running the python script on /dev/null causes the program to throw an
exception because the index is out of range. This is because the argument file
/dev/null that we passed into randline.py is completely empty so the script 
cannot index it at all.

Question 4
==========
Running the same script under Python 3 after exporting the path also results
in an error. This time however, it is a syntax error than an exception, 
probably because of switching over to Python 3 from Python 2.
