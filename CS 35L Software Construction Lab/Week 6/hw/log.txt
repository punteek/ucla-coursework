Upon installing Ubuntu onto my Virtual Machine (VirtualBox), I ran the
following commands in the Linux CLI to install OpenSSH.

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install openssh-server
sudo apt-get install openssh-client

To create an account on my server, I ran the following commands as admin

sudo useradd -d /home/newuser -m newuser
sudo passwd newuser 
- after this I typed in a simple password for newuser

I then cd'd into the newly created directory and created a new directory
called .ssh with the sudo command. Next, I changed the permissions of the
folder by doing

sudo chown -R newuser .ssh
sudo chmod 700 .ssh

After this, I used the ifconfig command to get my server IP address. To check
if the server is working, I used 

ps aux | grep ssh
- this showed a process named 'sshd' which means it was workingi

As a client, I ran the following commands

ssh-keygen
- make public and private keys
ping <serverIPAddress> 
- check to see if server is responding
ssh-copy-id -i <userName>@<serverIPAddress>
- gives server the client's pub key
ssh-add
- adds client's private key to ssh-agent so no need to type password again to
  login
ssh <userName>@<serverIPAddress>
ssh -X <userName>@<serverIPAddress>
- X-session forwarding to show GUI elements on our computer

I then tested this X-session forwarding by runnign commands like xterm,
firefox, and gedit. The GUI successfully displayed on my windows, indicating
that it worked.
