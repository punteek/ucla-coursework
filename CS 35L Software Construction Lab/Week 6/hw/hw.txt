Question 1
==========
If the other teams had been observing all the bytes going across the network, 
my resulting network would still be secure. This is because we used ssh to 
connect and so all the data being sent across has already been encrypted first
by the session key. The other teams would basically be seeing gibberish being
sent.

However, if the other teams had recorded my team's keystrokes, then our network
would be at risk. The encryption only happens in between the connections but 
if they know what we type at each end, then they know the decrypted messages
that may contain our usernames or passwords.

Similarly, if the other teams had physical control of the USB I'm using to 
boot, our security would also be compromised. They would have access to my 
private key, especially if it's not passphrase protected, and therefore be 
able to decrypt messages that are sent to me.

==========
Question 2
==========
The gpg --verify command does not actually verify that whoever signed the
file question personally created it. Anyone can use the command and so anyone
can sign a file and pose as another person.

A solution to this would be to have a third party manage the public keys. The
senders would then use the third party's public key to encrypt. The only con 
for this is that senders must trust that third party to manage their keys.
